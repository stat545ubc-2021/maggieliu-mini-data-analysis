# STAT545A Fall 2021 Mini Data Analysis

This is Maggie Liu's repository for the STAT545A Fall 2021 Mini Data Analysis project. In this project, we explore some of the datasets provided by the `datateachr` R package, choose a dataset, create visualizations related to that dataset, and run analyses on it to answer some research questions.

The dataset I eventually chose to analyze is `cancer_sample`. See a description of the dataset and its columns on the [UBC-MDS datateachr page](https://rdrr.io/github/UBC-MDS/datateachr/man/cancer_sample.html).

### Project Milestones

Below are brief descriptions of each milestone in this project, along with a checked box if the milestone was completed.

  - Explore datasets provided by `datateachr` package
  - Narrow down datasets of interest from 4 to 2 to 1
  - Write research questions I'd like to answer about the chosen dataset. The dataset I chose was `cancer_sample`
- [x] **Milestone 2** (October 19, 2021)
  - Summarize data in a way that makes sense for each of the 4 research questions created in Milestone 1
  - Explore tidy and un-tidy data using my dataset, `cancer_sample`
  - Pick 2 of the 4 research questions from Milestone 1 for continued analysis in Milestone 3
  - Create a version of the `cancer_sample` dataset that will help to answer the 2 research questions
- [ ] **Milestone 3** (October 23, 2021)
